1. Open electronic workbench.

2. Go to "Instruments".

3. Open "Logical Converter" from the "Instruments" and type the following expression: 
A'(B'(C'(D'E)))+A'(B'(C'(DE)))+A'(B'(C(D'E)))+A'(B'(C(DE)))+A(B'(C'(D'E)))+A(B'(C(D'E)))+A(B'(C'(DE)))+A(B'(C(DE)))

4. In the logical converter -> in the "Conversions" section press second last/fifth option ,this will create the whole diagram.

5. Select and delete all the OR gates ,then go to "Logic Gates" and select an OR gate.

6. Right click on the OR gate, select "Component Properties"  and then go to "Number of Inputs" and select desired numbers.

7. Now one by one connect the output of all the AND gates to the input of OR gate.

8. Go to "Indicators" , select "Red Prob" drag and drop it on the screen.

9. Rotate the prob and attach it to the output of OR gate.

10. Connect the inputs of the "logical converter" to the diagram.

11. Connect the last input dot of the "logical converter" to the connection line(output of OR gate) between OR gate and prob.

12. Right click on the prob and select "Component Properties", enter your id in the "Lable" section and press enter -> this will display you id on the screen.

13. Now click on the arrow on the "logical converter" which will open "logical converter" extended box form ,click on the first option from "Conversions" section, this will create a truth table of the expression.

14. Now click on the third option from "Conversions" section which will create a simplified form of the truth table.

15. Now click on the last option from "Conversions" section which will display the NAND-based gate of the expression.
